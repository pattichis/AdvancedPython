# Homework 2: Computing image feature distances using GPUs 

The purpose of this homework is to explore the use of GPUs for speeding up time-consuming operations in image processing.
The homework also explores the use of AI tools for writing code.

Suppose that we are given $m$ vectors:
```math
   X_0, X_1, \dots, X_{m-1}
```
where each vector has $n$ elements.

The vectors are stored in a 2-D $m \times n$ image array $X$ as follows:<br>
* Each row represents a different feature vector (e.g., $X_i$, $X_j$).
* The feature vectors are stored across the columns.
We want to compute the squared Euclidean distances between the different vectors:
```math
   \text{dostamce} (X_i, X_j) = (X_i[0] - X_j[0])^2 + (X_i[1] - X_j[1])^2 + \dots + (X_i[n-1] - X_j[n-1])^2,
   \quad i, j = 0, 1, \dots, m-1
```
where $n$ denotes both the number of elements in each vector.
