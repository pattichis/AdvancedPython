# Homework 2: Computing image feature distances using GPUs 

The purpose of this homework is to explore the use of GPUs for speeding up time-consuming operations in image processing.
The homework also explores the use of AI tools for writing code.

Suppose that we are given $n$ vectors:
```math
   X_0, X_1, \dots, X_{n-1}
```
where each vector has $n$ elements.

The vectors are stored in a 2-D $m \times n$ image array $X$ as follows:<br>
* Each row represents a different feature vector (e.g., $X_i$, $X_j$).
* The feature vectors are stored across the columns.
We want to compute the squared Euclidean distances between the different vectors:
```math
   D_{i, j} = \text{distance} (X_i, X_j) = (X_i[0] - X_j[0])^2 + (X_i[1] - X_j[1])^2 + \dots + (X_i[d-1] - X_j[d-1])^2,
   \quad i, j = 0, 1, \dots, n-1
```
where $n$ denotes both the number of elements in each vector. 

# Problem 1. Construct ground truth for $D$ (20 points)
Consider the simple example given by:<br>
```math
   X = \begin{bmatrix}
          0  & 1 & 2  & 3  \\
          10 & 5 & 12 & 20 \\
          21 & 4 & 7  & 3   
       \end{bmatrix}
```
A. Compute the $3 \times 3$ distance matrix $D$. <br>
B.
