# AdvancedPython
The goal of the repository is to provide advanced Python examples.

[Speed up Python execution 10X to 50X with one line of code!](https://github.com/pattichis/AdvancedPython/blob/main/Decorators_and_Numba.ipynb) Demonstrates the use of @njit to speed up functions.

[FastPython.ipynb](https://github.com/pattichis/AdvancedPython/blob/main/FastPython.ipynb) demonstrates the speedups using NumPy and Numba with CPUs and GPUs.

## Cuda:
To run fast algorithms on Cuda, follow
[RAPIDS installation and basic examples](https://github.com/pattichis/AdvancedPython/blob/main/RAPIDS.ipynb)
