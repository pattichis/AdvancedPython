# AdvancedPython
The repository's goal is to provide advanced Python examples.

## High-performance Python using Numba and Numba on Cuda
[Speed up Python execution 10X to 50X with one line of code!](https://github.com/pattichis/AdvancedPython/blob/main/Decorators_and_Numba.ipynb) Demonstrates the use of @njit to speed up functions.
 
[Speed up Python for pairwise distances calculation up from 164X using NumPy, 188X using njit, and up to 800X using Cuda threads](https://github.com/pattichis/AdvancedPython/blob/main/FastPython.ipynb). The example demonstrates speedups with NumPy and Numba on CPUs and GPUs.

## Cuda Examples
* [Cuda programming model](https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/cuda-refresher-cuda-programming-model/).
* [CuPy is a NumPy/SciPy-compatible array library for GPU-accelerated computing with Python](https://docs.cupy.dev/en/stable/overview.html).
* [Programming tiles in Cuda using cuTile](https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/cutile-python/).
* To run fast algorithms on Cuda, follow
[RAPIDS installation and DBScan clustering example](https://github.com/pattichis/AdvancedPython/blob/main/RAPIDS.ipynb).

## Apple Silicon
You can run machine learning models optimized for M1-M5 hardware using [MLX framework](https://mlx-framework.org).

## Advanced Models and Datasets for Medical Image and Video Analysis
[Extensive list of models and datasets](https://github.com/pattichis/AIM/blob/main/README.md).
The list includes general-purpose foundation models (e.g., SAM3D) and essential PyTorch links.
