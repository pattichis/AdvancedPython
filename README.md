# AdvancedPython
The repository's goal is to provide advanced Python examples.

## SAM 3D: Foundation Model for Single-Image 3D Reconstruction
* [SAM 3D main website](https://ai.meta.com/sam3d/), 
* [Tutorial from OpenCV](https://learnopencv.com/sam-3d/), [GitHub](https://github.com/facebookresearch/sam-3d-objects),
* [Demo playground](https://www.aidemos.meta.com/segment-anything/editor/convert-image-to-3d).

## High-performance Python
[Speed up Python execution 10X to 50X with one line of code!](https://github.com/pattichis/AdvancedPython/blob/main/Decorators_and_Numba.ipynb) Demonstrates the use of @njit to speed up functions.
 
[Speed up Python for pairwise distances calculation up from 164X using NumPy, 188X using njit, and up to 800X using Cuda threads](https://github.com/pattichis/AdvancedPython/blob/main/FastPython.ipynb). The example demonstrates speedups with NumPy and Numba on CPUs and GPUs.

## Cuda:
To run fast algorithms on Cuda, follow
[RAPIDS installation and DBScan clustering example](https://github.com/pattichis/AdvancedPython/blob/main/RAPIDS.ipynb).
